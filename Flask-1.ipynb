    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework? \n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It's designed to make building web applications in Python simple and straightforward, with a focus on simplicity, minimalism, and extensibility. Flask is often referred to as a micro-framework because it provides the core functionalities needed for web development without imposing too many dependencies or constraints.\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "Simplicity: Flask has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy for developers to get started with web development. Its minimalist design allows developers to focus on building their applications without unnecessary boilerplate code.\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask is highly flexible and allows developers to choose the tools and libraries they prefer for various components of their web applications. This flexibility makes it easy to integrate with existing systems and adapt Flask-based applications to changing requirements.\n",
    "Modularity: Flask follows a modular design approach, allowing developers to organize their code into reusable components such as blueprints, extensions, and middlewares. This modular structure promotes code organization, maintainability, and scalability.\n",
    "Extensibility: Flask provides a rich ecosystem of extensions that add additional features and functionalities to the framework. These extensions cover a wide range of use cases including authentication, database integration, caching, and more, allowing developers to easily extend Flask-based applications with minimal effort.\n",
    "Jinja2 Templating: Flask comes with built-in support for Jinja2, a powerful and feature-rich templating engine for Python. Jinja2 templates allow developers to easily generate dynamic HTML content by embedding Python code directly into HTML templates, making it easy to create dynamic and responsive web applications.\n",
    "Werkzeug WSGI Toolkit: Flask is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, which provides low-level utilities for handling HTTP requests and responses. This allows Flask to handle routing, request parsing, and other HTTP-related tasks efficiently and reliably.\n",
    "Community and Documentation: Flask has a vibrant community of developers and enthusiasts who contribute to its development and maintenance. The Flask community provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources to help developers learn and master the framework, making it easy to find solutions to common problems and share knowledge with others.\n",

    "Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in  Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",

    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes? \n",
    "In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to view functions, allowing you to define how your web application responds to different HTTP requests. This mapping is established using the @app.route() decorator, which associates a URL pattern with a specific Python function. When a request matches a URL pattern defined in an app route, Flask calls the associated function to generate the HTTP response.\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask for several reasons:\n",
    "URL Mapping: App routes allow us to map specific URLs to corresponding functionalities or views within our Flask application. This enables us to define the structure and behavior of our web application's endpoints.\n",
    "Request Handling: App routes define how our Flask application handles different types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. By associating each route with a specific request method, we can execute different code logic based on the type of request received.\n",
    "Code Organization: App routes help organize our Flask application's code by grouping related functionalities into separate view functions. Each route typically corresponds to a specific feature or page within the application, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "URL Generation: Flask provides a convenient mechanism for generating URLs dynamically within templates or Python code using the url_for() function. App routes facilitate this URL generation by providing named routes that can be referenced when generating links or redirects.\n",
    "RESTful APIs: For building RESTful APIs, app routes are essential for defining the endpoints that clients can interact with to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. Each route represents a specific resource or collection of resources, making it easy to design and implement RESTful API endpoints.\n",

    "Q4.  Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/”  route to show the following details: \n",
