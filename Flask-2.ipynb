    "Q1. Explain GET and POST methods. \n",
    "GET and POST are two of the most commonly used HTTP methods, each serving distinct purposes in web development:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET Method:\n",
    "Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "Usage: When a client sends a GET request to a server, it asks the server to retrieve or fetch a resource identified by a URL.\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Parameters are sent in the URL's query string.\n",
    "GET requests are typically idempotent, meaning making the same request multiple times should produce the same result.\n",
    "GET requests can be cached by browsers and intermediaries (like proxies), making them suitable for retrieving data that doesn't change frequently.\n",
    "GET requests should not be used for sensitive data or operations that modify server state, as the data is visible in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "Usage: When a client sends a POST request to a server, it submits data, which could be in the form of form data, JSON, or any other format, to the server for processing.\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Parameters are sent in the request body, not in the URL.\n",
    "POST requests are not idempotent, meaning making the same request multiple times can produce different results (e.g., submitting a form multiple times can create multiple records in a database).\n",
    "POST requests are not cached by browsers or intermediaries by default, making them suitable for operations that modify server state or sensitive data.\n",
    "POST requests can handle larger data payloads compared to GET requests, as there is no limit on the size of the request body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Why is request used in Flask? \n",
    "In Flask, the request object is used to access incoming request data sent by the client (e.g., web browser) to the server. It provides convenient access to various components of an HTTP request, such as request headers, form data, query parameters, cookies, and file uploads. The request object allows Flask developers to interact with and process the data sent by clients in their Flask applications.\n",
    "Here are some common use cases and reasons why the request object is used in Flask:\n",
    "Accessing Form Data: When a client submits a form to a Flask application, the form data is accessible via the request.form attribute. This allows developers to extract and process the form data submitted by the user.\n",
    "Handling Query Parameters: The request.args attribute provides access to the query parameters (key-value pairs) included in the URL of a GET request. Developers can use this attribute to retrieve and utilize query parameters in their Flask views.\n",
    "Retrieving Request Headers: The request.headers attribute allows developers to access the headers sent by the client as part of the HTTP request. This includes headers such as User-Agent, Content-Type, Authorization, etc., which can be useful for various purposes such as authentication, content negotiation, and user tracking.\n",
    "Handling Cookies: The request.cookies attribute provides access to the cookies sent by the client as part of the HTTP request. Developers can use this attribute to read, set, or modify cookies as needed within their Flask applications.\n",
    "Processing File Uploads: When a client uploads files to a Flask application, the files are accessible via the request.files attribute. This attribute allows developers to handle file uploads, including saving uploaded files to the server, validating file types, and processing file contents.\n",
    "Accessing Request Methods and URLs: The request.method attribute provides the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used in the request, while the request.url attribute provides the URL of the request. These attributes are useful for conditionally executing code based on the request method or accessing information about the request URL\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Why is redirect() used in Flask? \n",
    "In Flask, the redirect() function is used to redirect the client's web browser to a different URL. It generates an HTTP response with a 302 status code (temporary redirect) or another appropriate redirect status code, instructing the client to request the new URL specified in the function call.\n",
    "Here are some common use cases and reasons why the redirect() function is used in Flask:\n",
    "URL Routing: When a user accesses a specific URL in a Flask application, the application may need to redirect them to a different URL based on certain conditions or criteria. For example, after processing a form submission, the application may redirect the user to a \"thank you\" page or a different page based on the form data.\n",
    "Authentication and Authorization: In web applications that require user authentication or authorization, the redirect() function can be used to redirect unauthenticated or unauthorized users to a login page or an access denied page. After successful authentication or authorization, the user can be redirected back to the original URL or a specific destination.\n",
    "Handling POST-Redirect-GET (PRG) Pattern: The PRG pattern is a common web development practice where form submissions are followed by a redirect to prevent duplicate form submissions when the user refreshes the page. After processing a form submission with a POST request, the application can use the redirect() function to redirect the user to a different URL with a GET request, ensuring that the form data is not resubmitted.\n",
    "Changing URLs: When restructuring or updating a web application, the redirect() function can be used to redirect old URLs to new URLs, ensuring that users who access outdated URLs are automatically redirected to the correct pages. This helps maintain a seamless user experience and avoids broken links or 404 errors.\n",
    "External Redirects: The redirect() function can also be used to redirect users to external URLs outside of the Flask application. This can be useful for integrating with external services or directing users to third-party websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used? \n",
    "In Flask, templates are files containing static content mixed with placeholders for dynamic data. These placeholders, typically written using a templating language like Jinja2, allow developers to generate dynamic HTML pages by injecting data into predefined HTML structures. Templates enable the separation of presentation logic from business logic, making it easier to maintain and modify web applications.\n",
    "Here's why templates are used in Flask:\n",
    "Dynamic Content: Templates allow developers to generate dynamic content by injecting data into HTML pages. This data can come from various sources such as database queries, form submissions, or API responses.\n",
    "Code Reusability: Templates promote code reusability by allowing developers to define common layout structures and components that can be reused across multiple pages within the application.\n",
    "Separation of Concerns: Templates facilitate the separation of presentation logic from business logic, following the principle of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This separation makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and test.\n",
    "Customization: Templates provide flexibility for customizing the appearance and layout of web pages without modifying the underlying Python code. Developers can easily update templates to incorporate new designs or user interface elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Create a simple API. Use Postman to test it. Attach the screenshot of the output in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "from flask import Flask, jsonify\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "@app.route('/api/hello', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "      data = {'message': 'Hello, World!'}\n",
    "    return jsonify(data)\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n"
